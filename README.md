# 2018-spring-statistics-TA



This course is taught by Dr.Heari. My main task includes: <br>
* Creating and designing assignments 
* Conducting classes for students, in which extra content and concepts were presented. Such as:
  ** Probabilistic Cache Schedule Algorithms
  ** Naive Bayes Classifier as a simple example of PGMs
  ** Why we use MSE? Proofing that A Maximum Likelihood Estimation with Gaussian noise is equal to minimizing the MSE
  ** Bootstrap as a way to estimate a Statistic and then construct a confidence interval.
  ** Random Walk

teach extra content for enthusiastic students. 
Assignments has two parts. 
> Questions<br>
> Computer Experiment<br>
#### Questions includes:
* Calculating Probabilities
* Proofing the property
* Modeling some real world example with our statistical tools
#### Computer Experiment  includes: 
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Sampling From a Distribution and Plotting corresponding Graphs
